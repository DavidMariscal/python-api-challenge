Python API Homework - What's the Weather Like?

Written description of three observable trends based on the data


1.) Temperature reaches the highest values on latitude 20 within the 100 degrees Ferinhite. 

2.) Temperatures are higher at latitudes closer to the equator. Temperatures are lower towards the earth's poles. Which corresponds to Southern Hemisphere and Northern Hemisphere, respectively. 

3.) Wind speed reaches 35 mph after latitude 20. Datasets for cloudiness and wind speed show some outliers, though seems to be the normal behaviour for such an extensive amount of data

For Vacations, cities around latitude 20 seems to have nicer Weather.
